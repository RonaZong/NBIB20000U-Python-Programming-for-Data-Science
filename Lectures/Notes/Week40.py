# Linear Search
# Binary Search - Exclude half of the list each time

# Computational Complexity
# a conservative estimate of the number of steps necessary to complete the algorithm

# formally described using the big-O notation
# Big-O notation: Mathematical notation that describes the asymptotic behaviour of a function
# Think of the time complexity of a program as a function f(n) of the input size n.
# As the input size grows, the execution time typically grows
# The O formalism is designed to give an upper bound
